# Projects

- [Calculator](#calculator)

## Calculator
Build a simple single-page calculator.  
It should have numbers from 0 to 9, plus, minus, divide, and multiply buttons with their actions.  
Also, a label to show the result of the process.
  
#### Goals
- Getting familiar with communication between the controller and its view
- Aligning UI components regularly
- Understanding the logic mechanism in the controller
- Making a meaningful, tidy folder structure
  
#### Architecture
Use the pure MVC which is the simplest architecture in iOS development. No need for a view model.
  
#### Language / Framework
Swift with UIKit. No need to use SwiftUI for now.
  
#### Responsive Design
Use only one storyboard. Make all design processes in a single storyboard. No need to create separated storyboards or xib files.  
Fill the buttons on the screen by using horizontal and vertical stack views.  
Use constraints to make a dynamic sized stack view.
You are free to align the buttons as you wish.
  
#### Keywords
